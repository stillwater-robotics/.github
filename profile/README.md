# Stillwater Robotics

Imagine a mission statement here. Something serene and beuatiful.

BAM! oil all ovver. bleh bleh bleh! geese crying. Ducks with slicked back feathers like the movie grease. Actual grease.

Its our mission to make robots that document this. Then someone could fix it after or something.

Guys I shouldn't be in charge of this README
